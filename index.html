        <h1>Exquisite Corpse</h1>
      </header>
      <p>"Wow, what an equisite corpse" said the man, staring at the Frankenstein's monster, pieced together in front of him. This wild being made from discarded bits and bobs was a feast for his eyes. The man was staring, maybe too intently if you asked the undertaker. He interrupted his gazing to ask "What's your plan for this thing anyway?"</p>

      <p>"Well... It's not unreasonable to assume he'll be well-adapted to this highly social world we live in," said Dr. Frankenstein. In the distance, fireworks from a local party could be heard; it was to be the monster's debut performance. Designed to be a local birthday party clown, Frankenstein's monster would be sure to lighten the hearts of thousands across the land. It was the scientist's last shot at redemption, and hopes were high that the monster would be financial salvation in a time of despair.</p>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>"Uhh..." The undertaker groaned, "I guess so, dude. That'll be 33 bitcoin by the way." And away the two went, Frankenstein and his clown monster walking excitedly, the scientist as giddy as a schoolboy at playtime and the monster like a guy who just looks happy that he survived a drowning. Approaching the local town of Ingolstadt, Germany's 134th annual X Factor, where the scientist had promised fox entertainment "the show of their life", the air of around the stadium was heavy with the roaring screams of the local farmers and <em>all</em> of their animals, in anticipation of a prodigious show.</p>

      <p>In the cheers, frankstein's monster appeared. Although he was dressed as a clown, his horrible face and huge body scared the children to cry. Adults are very excited. There are fans in the crowd holding up the sign. When the "clown" clumsily performed acrobatics, people sent out a burst of exclamation, a female monster appeared in the crowd! She was frankstein's monster's dream lover for many years! The clown rushes into the crowd like crazy. The show is out of control</p>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax image4"></div>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>"Boooooo! Hissssss!" went the crowd in anger as the star-crossed lovers embraced each other. The monster stripped away his foolish clown make up to reveal his "exquisite" monster features. "Oh how I've missed you my love!" shouted the monster while gazing into his soul-mate's eyes. "Unfortunately, now is not the time for warm welcomes," replied the female monster with a tremble of fear in voice. The X Factor crowd, deprived of a night full of high-flying clown antics, began throwing rotten tomatoes at the monsterous couple, causing them to flee back to the stage for safety. Pandemonium was about to break lose from the crowd! But the smooth, sexy, British voice of X Factor judge and renowned record producer Simon Cowell stopped the madness and contiued on to say... </p>

        "Congratulations! I've waited so long for this moment.
        In all my years of judging, I've only wanted one thing from my performers.
        To learn what love is."
        The crowd was silent. They couldn't disrespect Mr Cowell.
        Frankenstein chimed in, "they're just monsters, they don't ..."
        and then he saw it. She was a party clown monster too.
        As he trailed off, she looked back at her beloved, and in a moment that
        would go down in television history, planted a kiss that not only conveyed
        the intense, soulful love of two monsters who can party, but also
        managed to transfer a significant amount of her own party clown makeup back
        onto his chiseled, undead face. The impressionistic smears across the monster's
        visage reminded Frankenstein of his summers in the circus. He fell to his knees
        and began to weep, before shouting the following at the top of his lungs.

      <p>"I'm not a monster ！！！" his angry roar even broke the lights on the stage, and the crowd fell into a dead silence, except for the children who were frightened to cry again. Dr Frankenstein said hastily, "let's bless them! "I don't know if people who are moved or scared start cheering and clapping. The monster gradually calms down and looks at his lover affectionately. A month later, the wedding began...</p>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>Every monster, ghoul, demon, weirdo, freak, circus act, clown, and evil scientist from across the 7 seas has been in anticipation of this momentous occasion for the month that this wedding between Monster and Ms. Monster had blown up on Mwitter (Monster Twitter). They had all been invited to this monsterous wedding ceremony...</p>
      <p>In the grooms backroom before the wedding begins- "Hey..." The scientist  Frankenstein says, standing coyly his once cherised monster, as it fixes up the crisp crimson tie it has on. "You look good".</p>
      <p>"Thanksh Fwankie", The monster says with a lisp. "You know... I'm happhy for once. I-" Before he could finish his sentence, a buzz comes from across the room, it's someone's phone ringing. It looks like it's coming from Ms. Monster's backpack that she forgot in the room from earlier. "Who could that be", the scientist mumbles. As they approach the backpack, the buzzing continues louder and louder. The monster unzipps the backpack, grabbing Ms. Frankenstein's phone.<p>
      <p> The message reads: "from- PIZZA DELIVERY: hey babbe... i kno ur getting married today and i cant believe it... i need to see u and that fat lil &#x1F9DF; &#x1F351;"</p>
      <p> "Huh... I don't know how the pizza guy could get the wrong number like that, I'll have to tell Ms. Frankensein to remind him when she's over there getting the pizza next time".</p>

      <p>All the great monsters from around Europe came to support their wedding. At the head of the church stood Frankenstein's monster, dressed in dapper attire. All the farm animals from the night of the show filled the pews in excitedment for the two clown to get married. Even Simon Cowell agreed to officate the ceremony. The front doors swung open as the veiled bride began her stride down the aisle. But suddenly, a cloud of bats broke through the stained glass and impeded the brides way to her future husband. It was Dracula! The dastardly vampire was always jealous of the monster's good looks ever since they graduated clown school. In a swift move to protect his bride, Frankenstein's monster engaged in battle with Dracula...  </p>

      <p>Dracula, to the confusion of onlookers, stepped back and yelled "Pizza is served!," as he commanded his fleet of flying rodents to attack. The groom thought back to the text message he had somehow received on a the pre-telegraph device that was common at the time. "<em>You're</em> the pizza delivery guy?!," asked the monster, his heart sinking. In the background, Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma hurried out of the Mystery Machine; there indeed was a mystery on their hands.</p>
      <p>The husband-to-be was heartbroken, and tears began to fall down his face...It turned out that he had lost both his fiance and his best friend that day. He swatted away the bats, which was the obvious solution for the eight-foot-tall mourner as these were just bats, and pulled a bouquet of flowers out of his magicians hat. He was planning on showing that he had been practicing more than just the artform of the clown. What happened next was totally unexpected.</p>
      <p>"Simon Cowell?," he said as the crowd gasped, "Would you make me the happiest monster in the world and be my wife?" There was obviously some deep misunderstanding on the part of Frankenstein's monster..., or so the onlookers thought. A tear of joy ran down Cowell's cheek, however. He said, "Let's get the hell out of here," and put on his finest v-neck shirt. The two were never heard from again.</p>
