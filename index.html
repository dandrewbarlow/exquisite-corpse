        <h1>Exquisite Corpse</h1>
      </header>
      <p>"Wow, what an equisite corpse" said the man, staring at the Frankenstein's monster, pieced together in front of him. This wild being made from discarded bits and bobs was a feast for his eyes. The man was staring, maybe too intently if you asked the undertaker. He interrupted his gazing to ask "what's your plan for this thing anyway?"</p>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>"Well... It's not unreasonable to assume he'll be well-adapted to this highly social world we live in," said Dr. Frankenstein. In the distance, fireworks from a local party could be heard; it was to be the monster's debut performance. Designed to be a local birthday party clown, Frankenstein's monster would be sure to lighten the hearts of thousands across the land. It was the scientist's last shot at redemption, and hopes were high that the monster would be financial salvation in a time of despair.</p>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>"Uhh..." The undertaker groaned, "I guess so, dude. That'll be 33 bitcoin by the way." And away the two went, Frankenstein and his clown monster walking excitedly, the scientist as giddy as a schoolboy at playtime and the monster like a guy who just looks happy that he survived a drowning. Approaching the local town of Ingolstadt, Germany's 134th annual X Factor, where the scientist had promised fox entertainment "the show of their life", the air of around the stadium was heavy with the roaring screams of the local farmers and ALL of their animals, in anticipation of a prodigious show.</p>

      <p>In the cheers, frankstein's monster appeared. Although he was dressed as a clown, his horrible face and huge body scared the children to cry. Adults are very excited. There are fans in the crowd holding up the sign. When the "clown" clumsily performed acrobatics, people sent out a burst of exclamation, a female monster appeared in the crowd! She was frankstein's monster's dream lover for many years! The clown rushes into the crowd like crazy. The show is out of control</p>
    </div>

    <div class="parallax image4"></div>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>"Boooooo! Hissssss!" went the crowd in anger as the star-crossed lovers embraced each other. The monster stripped away his foolish clown make up to reveal his "exquisite" monster features. "Oh how I've missed you my love!" shouted the monster while gazing into his soullmate's eyes. "Unfotunately, now is not the time warm welcomes," replied the female monster with a tremble of fear in voice. The X Factor crowd, deprived of a night full of high-flying clown antics, began throwing rotten tomatoes at the monsterous couple, casuing them to flee back to the stage for safety. Pandemonium was about to break lose from the crowd! But the smooth, sexy, British voice of X Factor judge and renowned record producer Simon Cowell stopped the madness and contiued on to say... </p>

    <div class="parallax image5"></div>

    <div class="textContainer">
      <p>
        "Congratulations! I've waited so long for this moment.
        In all my years of judging, I've only wanted one thing from my performers.
        To learn what love is."
        The crowd was silent. They couldn't disrespect Mr Cowell.
        Frankenstein chimed in, "they're just monsters, they don't ..."
        and then he saw it. She was a party clown monster too.
        As he trailed off, she looked back at her beloved, and in a moment that
        would go down in television history, planted a kiss that not only conveyed
        the intense, soulful love of two monsters who can party, but also
        managed to transfer a significant amount of her own party clown makeup back
        onto his chiseled, undead face. The impressionistic smears across the monster's
        visage reminded Frankenstein of his summers in the circus. He fell to his knees
        and began to weep, before shouting the following at the top of his lungs.
